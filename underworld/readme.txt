When night falls, the battle begins. Unbeknownst to the human world, a centuries-old feud between warring Vampire and Lycan (werewolf) clans is escalating to a bloody and brutal climax. Armed with an arsenal of deadly weapons both ancient and modern, these mortal enemies are unrelenting in their quest to wipe each other from the face of the earth. You must choose on which side you will fight. Will you align yourself with the lithe and elegant Vampires, or the brutally powerful Lycans? Prowling the dark city streets and subway tunnels, you are compelled to destroy your ancient enemies while searching for The Hybrid -- a human with the power to make your people invincible.

Underworld Bloodline is a teamplay game similar to Capture the Flag, but uses a live target instead of a flag. Your goal is to find and capture the Hybrids and return them safely to a prison cell at your home base, battling any enemy fighters in your path. To locate and secure a Hybrid, look for the one in the bar or restaurant in the city. Press 'E' to make him follow you, press 'E' again to make him stop. Once you get him inside the cell, activate the prison cell button to capture him. Once captured, the Hybrids will regenerate and win points for your team. Each team scores 1 point for every enemy kill, 10 points for a Hybrid capture, but loses 5 points if they kill the Hybrid by accident. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.
